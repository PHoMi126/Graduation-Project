Introduction
Level Editor draws an invisible plane at specific Height, this is use as a limit for the Brush.
You can left click to Create or Delete objects inside the Brush bounds.
You can also set the Paint mode to Single so you can place objects on top of each other using a collider.

1 Menu
	1.1 Edit
	Press the ESC key to toggle on/off the edit mode.
	Level Editor will only take further input when edit toggle is on.

	1.2 2D View
	Allows for the 2D placement of objects on a XY plane.

	1.3 Mode
	Press the ‘C’ key to loop through all the modes available, alternatively you can use the Unity Commands
	Keys to switch to Move/Rotate/Scale/Rect
	Modes (‘W’, ‘E’, ‘R’, ‘T’ Keys)

		1.3.1 Create
		Allows you to create one or more objects with one click.
		Make sure you’ve selected at least one object from the list. On your scene view, left click to place the object.

		1.3.2 Delete
		Works similar to Create Mode, move your mouse over the object you want to delete,
		anything inside and contained by the Layers selected with be deleted with left click.

		1.3.3 Move
		Allows you to move objects just as unity would, but will always snap to the Snap value.

		1.3.4 Rotate
		Allows you to rotate objects with the Unity default handles snapping to the Rotate value

		1.3.5 Scale
		Allows you to scale objects with the Unity default handles snapping to the Scale value.

		1.3.6 Rect
		Allows you to move and resize SpriteRnderers with the Unity default handles snapping its value.
		Make sure "Draw Mode" is set to "Sliced or Tiled" on your SpriteRenderer component.

	1.4 Paint
	Press the ‘B’ key to loop through the different paint modes.

		1.4.1 Single
		Create - Left click to place an object onto the plane of the Height value selected.
		If there’s an object with a collider under the cursor, the brush position will snap to the mouse position in worldspace.
		
		Delete - Left click to delete an object or objects inside the Brush Area of Size.
		If there’s an object with a collider on the way it will snap the brush position to the object position.

		1.4.2 Brush
		Create - Left click and drag mouse to create objects on SceneView.
		
		Delete - Left click and drag mouse to delete objects inside the Brush Area.

	1.5 Layer
	Use this to select the layers you want to work with, the others layers will be ignore.

	1.6 Height
	The position in Y of the invisible plane onto which the objects are created or placed. Press the key “-” to lower the plane by Size Y or the key “+” to raise the plane by Size Y.

	1.7 Size
	The size of the brush to paint where 1,1,1 will create 1 object.

2 Snap
	2.1 Move
	The snap value for position objects.
	The first float field is for the value of x, the second float field is for the value of y and the third float value for the value of z
	Meaning where x = 1, y = 1, z = 1, the object position value will be snapped in multiples of 1 in each direction

	2.2 Rotate
	The snap value for rotating objects
	The first float field is for the value of x, the second float field is for the value of y and the third float value for the value of z
	Meaning where x = 1, y = 1, z = 1, the object rotation value will be snapped in multiples of 1 in each direction

	2.3 Scale
	The snap value for scaling objects
	The first float field is for the value of x, the second float field is for the value of y and the third float value for the value of z
	Meaning where x = 1, y = 1, z = 1, the object scale value will be snapped in multiples of 1 in each direction

3 Parent
	3.1 When an object is selected It's considered the Target Parent, meaning: objects will be placed as children of
	the said parent.

	3.2 Child count will be displayed when a Target Parent is selected.

	3.3 Max Child Count: How many children is the Target Parent allowed to hold before Overflow.

4 Selected
Selected View, shows you the objects you’ve selected from the prefab list for creating objects.
Left click an object to remove from selection.


5 Objects
The group of objects created by the user, each group can hold up to 100 objects,
left click to select a single object, ctrl + left click to select multiple objects.
Right click for context menu, “select” to highlight the object in your Project Window
